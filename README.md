# Problem Statement
The Iris Flower – A Symbol of Beauty and Grace
The iris flower is one of nature’s most elegant and colorful blooms, admired for its intricate petals and vibrant hues. Belonging to the genus Iris, which includes over 300 species, this flower derives its name from the Greek word for "rainbow," reflecting the wide range of colors it exhibits—purple, blue, yellow, white, and more. In scientific research, the iris flower gained fame as the subject of the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning and data science.
