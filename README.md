# Problem Statement
## **The Iris Flower – A Symbol of Beauty and Grace**
The iris flower is one of nature’s most elegant and colorful blooms, admired for its intricate petals and vibrant hues. Belonging to the genus Iris, which includes over 300 species, this flower derives its name from the Greek word for "rainbow," reflecting the wide range of colors it exhibits—purple, blue, yellow, white, and more. In scientific research, the iris flower gained fame as the subject of the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning and data science.
## Objective
The Iris Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can identify the species of iris flowers—Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica—by analyzing the measurements of their petal and sepal lengths and widths. This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to a well-known classification problem, offering insights into the distinct features of various iris species and evaluating the performance of different algorithms in solving this task.
